## Welcome! I'm Greg Garman
 
        
### Computer Science student with experience developing mobile and desktop applications

### Get to know me
I am from Jacksonville, FL and am pursuing my second bachelors degree from Florida State University. I am a diehard sports fan (Go jags and Noles) and spend a lot of my time watching and attending sporting events with friends and family. My favorite hobby is traveling and I want to see as much of the world as possible and take as many pictures as I can! 

My interest in programming began in 2019 when I completed a simple python module on CodeCademy. Since then, I have grown a wonderful passion for learning new programming languages and developing as many different types of software as I can. 

Below are some of the apps I have worked on. I hope you enjoy and thanks for stopping by!
